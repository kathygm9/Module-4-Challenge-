### Written Report

This analysis examines the impact of excluding the 9th grade test scores from Thomas High School on both district and school summaries. We recalculated the percentages of students passing math, passing reading, and the overall passing rates. By doing this, we can see how the removal of these scores affects performance metrics at both levels.

**District Summary**

Removing the 9th grade scores from Thomas High School had a minimal effect on the overall district summary. The recalculated percentages for passing rates changed by less than 1%, showing that the omission of these scores had little impact on the overall dataset of nearly 40,000 students. The district's performance metrics remained largely stable despite the exclusion of less than 500 test scores.

**School Summary**

In contrast, the effect on Thomas High School was significant. Initially, the school had a 91% overall passing rate, which raised concerns for being unusually high. After recalculating with only the 10th-12th graders, the overall passing rate dropped dramatically to 65%. This significant decrease shows how much the 9th grade scores influenced the school's performance metrics. Additionally, the school's ranking within the district fell from 2nd to 8th out of 15 schools, highlighting the impact of the 9th grade data on its ranking.

**Additional Comparisons and Conclusions**

The exclusion of the 9th grade scores had minimal effect on the analysis of scores by school spending, size, and type. The changes were minor, only affecting the hundredths place in the calculated values. This indicates that while the 9th grade data significantly impacted Thomas High School's specific metrics, it had little effect on broader categories. Furthermore, the average math and reading scores for Thomas High School were recalculated without the 9th grade data, making the previous averages of 83.6 for math and 83.7 for reading inapplicable.

In summary, the overall passing rate at Thomas High School decreased from 91% to 65%, and its ranking dropped from 2nd to 8th within the district. While the removal of the 9th grade scores significantly impacted Thomas High Schoolâ€™s metrics, it had minimal effect on the overall district summary.
